            <p class="about-us-paragraph">Our society lacks an all-in-one space for the less integrated local community,<br>
                 living in a large or small city and who are not able to access the available services. It is even more <br>
                  unlikely to access the best and the most deserving ones who - as per definition - are the most reliable,<br>
                   talented, and passionate. On the other hand, most local professionals fail to provide access to information <br>
                    and online presence in English. As a result, a “simple and quick” Google search suddenly becomes <br>
                     a “frustrating and lengthy” task.  Language barriers together with the unfamiliarity with the environment <br>
                      will lead you to inaccurate results, and this is only the beginning of a tunnel of desperation and delusion.<br>
                    Jobidy's purpose is to leave time-consuming Google searches in the past by creating an all-in-one marketplace<br>
                     where people in need and service providers can meet, agree on a job, agree on a price, and maybe become<br>
                      best friends. Or just friends. It is up to you. Anyway, you may be wondering how we are going to do this, right?<br>
                     Well, [here] you can watch the video where we explain in just 30 seconds how this magic works.
